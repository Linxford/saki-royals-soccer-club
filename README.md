<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Overview

This project is a web application for "Saki Royals FC", a soccer club. It is developed using React, a widely-used JavaScript library for crafting user interfaces. The application encompasses multiple pages, such as a home page, about page, contact page, among others.

### About Page

Located at `src/pages/AboutPage.tsx`, this page provides details on the club's history, including its inception, notable achievements, and milestones. It also showcases the club's journey, emphasizing performance, training, and youth development initiatives.

### Additional Pages

- **Home Page** (`src/pages/HomePage.tsx`): Likely serves as the main portal for the application, highlighting the club's mission and values.
- **Contact Page** (`src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`): Facilitates communication with the club through a contact form or by displaying contact information.
- **Gallery Page** (`src/pages/GalleryPage.tsx`): Showcases a gallery of club-related images, including team photos and match highlights.

## Features and Functionalities

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices.
- **Navigation**: Features a menu for easy page transitions.
- **Routing**: Utilizes React Router for managing client-side routing.
- **State Management**: Employs React state and props for data and behavior handling.
- **Theming**: Leverages Material-UI for a cohesive visual theme.

## Deployment

Constructed with Create React App, a tool for building and deploying React apps. The project includes scripts for development (`npm start`), testing (`npm test`), and production build (`npm run build`).

In summary, this project serves as a straightforward web application for a soccer club, offering information on the club's activities and enabling user interaction.
